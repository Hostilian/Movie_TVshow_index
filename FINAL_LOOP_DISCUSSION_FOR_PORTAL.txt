YES - there IS a circular dependency (loop) in the Movie Database schema.

THE LOOP:
The MOVIE table contains a self-referencing foreign key called "sequel_of" 
that points back to movie_id within the same table. This creates a circular 
dependency where MOVIE references itself:

    MOVIE.sequel_of → MOVIE.movie_id

This relationship models movie sequel chains. For example, "The Dark Knight 
Rises" can reference "The Dark Knight" which can reference "Batman Begins", 
forming a franchise chain within the same entity.

WHY THIS LOOP EXISTS:
Movie franchises naturally form sequel relationships. The sequel_of column 
enables queries like finding all sequels to a movie or tracing complete 
franchise histories. This is a legitimate real-world modeling requirement 
for a movie database.

TECHNICAL IMPLICATIONS:
1. Recursive CTEs (WITH RECURSIVE) are needed to traverse sequel chains
2. Original movies must be inserted before their sequels
3. ON DELETE SET NULL prevents orphan references when originals are deleted
4. Application logic must prevent circular chains (Movie A → B → A)

BENEFITS:
Enables franchise analysis, sequel chain traversal, and maintains normalized 
relationships between related movies without requiring a separate table.
